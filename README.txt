	--Six Man's Morris--
Two players begin the game by placing pieces on the board, alternating placing one piece at a time until there are six of each colour.
From there, each players can move their pieces to adjacent spaces with the goal of creating a row of three of their pieces called a 
"mill". If a player creates a mill they can remove one of the other player's pieces. The goal of the game is to remove all but two of 
the opponent's pieces or prevent them from moving their pieces. Pieces are added by clicking on the desired location. Pieces are moved 
by clicking on said piece and them clicking on an open, adjacent spot. There are a variety of buttons on the game board: new games can 
be started by clicking on the New Game button; games can be saved by clicking on the Save Game button; saved games can be loaded using 
the Load Game button.
