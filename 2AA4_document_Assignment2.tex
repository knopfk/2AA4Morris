	This document describes the java project 6 Men's Morris. 
	\subsection{Architecture}

	This software uses MVC architecture in its design. MVC stands for Model, View, Controller, and is a design tool used in software development. The View contains all information the user sees, and interacts with the user. The Model contains all the data, and the Controller contains commands which modify the view and model. This architectural style is useful as it allows for modulation, and parts of the program can be modified without affecting any others.
	\subsection{Technologies}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Java:  An object oriented programming language 
		\item Eclipse: It is an IDE used for the development and testing of software typically in Java
		\item Java Swing: A java toolkit designed to aid programmers in the creation of gui applications. This widget toolkit allows the programmer quick access to various predefined graphical objects, allowing the easy creation of a graphical interface.

	\section{Modular Decomposition}
	% 4.1Description of the classes and modules and why they were used

		\end{figure}
	The modules chosen (as detailed in the Module Guide), were done so in order to make it straightforward for the 3 members involved in the project to code individually, and also to enforce modularity in the program. The GameDisplay, GameBoard and PiecePanel make up the View. The PiecePanel creates the tokens to take the user input, GameDisplay creates buttons to check or restart the game, and GameBoard displays the game data to the user. By dividing the View up in this way, if any of these functionalities need to be modified that can be done without affecting the other parts. The GameControl makes up the Controller. This controls the game logic, and is called by the View to make modifications to the game data based on user input. It makes sense for the Controller to be separate from the other modules, as any changes that are made to the game logic can be implemented without there being any change to what the user sees/interacts with, and likewise any changes to the user interface will not interfere with the game logic/data.

	In the above relation, a class points to another that it uses.
	The View calls the Controller, which in turn modifies the Model. In the future, the View will initially take input from the user. Then, depending on which component was clicked, will call a corresponding method in the controller. Clicking either the red or blue piece will call the newpiece method in GameControl. Clicking the check button will call checkboard(), and clicking the start button will call startboard(). These methods will then modify the model through the manipulation of arrays. \\

	\section{Discussion}
	%4.6 Internal review/ evaluation of design
	The design follows the MVC format very roughly. As it currently stands, the Model, View, and Controller are all spread across the same few classes: the Model is implemented in GameControl; the View is implemented in GameBoard, PiecePanel, and GameDisplay; and the Controller is implemented in GameDisplay. Each class, particularly GameDisplay, is doing much more than it should. Future iterations will have more modularized code, with features such as saving and loading being within their own class. If asked to judge the program, the group would give it a 7.5/10.
	\subsection{Anticipated Changes}
	% what was designed in anticipation of changes
	\begin{itemize}
	\item    GameControl: Will be able to track previous movements of pieces in the 'visibleteams' array (at present, can only add new pieces in and move them around). Arrays were designed to contain variables that could be modified in the future to reflect these changes. This could be used to implement the behavior of the AI in future projects. 
	In the future, the GameControl could be easily used with different dimensions (ie: 8 Men's Morris).  
	\item    Boardreturn: Class designed to hold variables needed to determine whether a move/new piece is legal. Returns a integer indicating the legality, and a int[][], indicating the current board array. Due to the design of a separate type to bundle this data, if any other data feedback is required in the future, it will be simple to add it in.
	\end{itemize}
